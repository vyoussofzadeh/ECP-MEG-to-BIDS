# ECP-MEG-BIDS-Converter

This repository contains scripts and tools designed to convert MEG datasets from the Epilepsy Connectome Project (ECP) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. The goal is to provide a standardized approach for handling neuroimaging data to facilitate research and analysis.

## Project Description

The Epilepsy Connectome Project aims to advance our understanding of epilepsy through detailed imaging studies. The Magnetic Encephalography (MEG) data collected offers rich, dynamic insights into brain activity. Converting this data into BIDS format standardizes the data structure, making it more accessible and interoperable for researchers across various disciplines.

## Features

- **Script to Convert Data**: Automate the conversion of ECP MEG data to BIDS format.
- **Validation Tool**: Ensure that the converted data adheres to BIDS specifications.
- **Documentation**: Detailed instructions and examples on how to use the tools and scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `mne`, `pybids`
